Because of the send grid key which was provided and it's not working. I get a 401 unauthorised error and the message is not send as such I fail to update the record with number of notified. I am however 100% sure my code works since I commented the mail sending part and everything worked. You can see more of what and how here I created a GitHub issue on the starter code and didn't get a feedback here https://github.com/udacity/nd081-c3-Migrating-Non-Native-Cloud-Applications-project-starter/issues/2

Also the screenshot found here are those taken when the email sending part are disabled as  was instructed in the previous reviews
